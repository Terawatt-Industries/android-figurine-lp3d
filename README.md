An homage to the designer Android figurines from Andrew Bell (http://www.deadzebra.com/).  The feet are short, there is a clear neck line, and the eyes are buggy; kinda like the figurines.

## Printing Recommendations
Honeycomb infill with transparent PLA looks pretty cool.  These parts are easy to print.  The only overhangs are the antennae.  Getting good quality on the antennae means slowing the printer down and/or a cooling fan.

## Assembly Instructions
Print the parts and glue them together.  Use a glue with a very low expansion rating.  For PLA this can become a challenge.  Hot glue and gorilla glue seem to work best on PLA but they expand too much and leave easily noticeable artifacts on small parts like these.  Super glue and low-expansion epoxy have worked best so far.  For ABS super glue works well.

The figurine is very small, approximately 30mm (1.25") height.  The antennae are extremely brittle.  They shouldn't break if it falls over on itself, but they will break from a few inches higher.
