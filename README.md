# Android Figurine LP3D
An homage to the designer Android figurines from Andrew Bell (http://www.deadzebra.com/).  The feet are short, there is a clear neck line, and the eyes are buggy; kinda like the figurines.

The figurine consists of three parts:  body(+feet), neck, and head.  The neck has a register to align with the head.  The assembled figurine is small, approximately 30mm (1.25") height.  The antennae are very fragile.  They shouldn't break if it falls over on itself, but they will break _easily_ from 50-100mm higher.  Dropping the figurine is a surefire way to break the antennae.

## Printing Recommendations
Honeycomb infill with transparent PLA looks pretty cool.  These parts are simple to print.  The only overhangs are the antennae and the register in the head.  Getting good quality on the antennae means slowing the printer down and/or a cooling fan.

## Assembly Instructions
The (3) parts are glued together to make the figurine.

1.  Use a glue with a negligible expansion rating.  For PLA this can become a challenge.  Hot glue and gorilla glue work reasonably well on PLA but they expand too much for this.  Super glue and low-expansion epoxy have worked best so far.  For ABS super glue works OK.  More options are discussed at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/makerbot/GkRt8Kpw1K8.
2.  Avoid using too much glue so it doesn't seep out the sides of the parts when pressed together.
3.  Check the fit of the neck register in the head.  You may need to de-burr the register.
4.  Apply glue inside the head register - there will probably be gaps to soak it up.  Apply glue to the neck register and to the flat surface around the register.
5.  Glue the neck to the head.
6.  Glue the body to the neck/head combo.  Align the head before the glue sets by using 3 or 4 fingers of a hand to line the two parts up.  Don't forget to line up the eyes.
7.  Let glue cure.  Don't drop it.
